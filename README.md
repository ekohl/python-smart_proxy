# Python Smart Proxy

This repository is a proof of concept of a [Foreman Smart Proxy](https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy) written in Python using [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/). It was part of an internal presentation and each commit is providing a small piece of functionality. In the end it implements part of the [Smart Proxy API](https://projects.theforeman.org/projects/smart-proxy/wiki/API).
